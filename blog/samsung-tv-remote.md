I connected my arduino and my logic analyzer to my laptop. Once in [Logic](https://www.saleae.com/downloads), the Saleae software to analyze signal, configure the sample rate to 1MS/s (digital) for a duration of 5 seconds and setup a trigger on rising edge to the appropriate channel (channel 0). The reason why I configure the sample rate so low is that typical carrier frequency for infrared is between [30kHz and 60kHz](https://os.mbed.com/users/4180_1/notebook/ir-and-rf-remote-controls/) (38kHz being the most common one). I then start the capture and press the "Volume up" button of my TV remote.
