Introduction
------------

This course will try to teach you about the different vulnerabilities identified in web application based on the [OWASP top ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) project. [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. OWASP developed and maintained the OWASP top ten project, which represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

What will this course teach you?

* Understanding the HTTP protocol
* Create vulnerable website (the easiest part)
* Understanding common vulnerabilities in web applications
* Finding vulnerabilities in web applications
* Fixing vulnerabilities in web applications

Before starting the course, we will need to clarify what is a web application and what are security vulnerabilities.

A __web application__, also known as __web app__, is a client–server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, boards, blogs, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application)].

A __security vulnerability__ is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_%28computing%29)]. Typically, a vulnerability will allow an attacker to compromise the __C__​onfidentiality and/or the __I__​ntegrity and/or the __A__​vailability of a system, hence the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Key_concepts) concept in IT security.
